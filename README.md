What is Evolutionary Emotions?
A REST API based simulated emotion neural network, built on the ideas of James-Lange Theory of Emotion, Dr. Paul Ekman universal emotions and Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor 90 second emotion rule. The system takes an event as an input, generates, also persists, simulated basic emotions and responds back with both verbal text and hypothetical physical reaction. The input events are assumed to be provided by various types of sensors, microphones and cameras.

Improvements Needed?
Yes, I was trying to build the event-emotion mapping logics based on Turing theory. Due to the complexity of the theory and the limited time that I had, the event-emotion mapping logic is at very basic level at the moment. However, I have made the feeling simulation formula adjustable via Postman calls.
